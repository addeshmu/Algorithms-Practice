Longest Character Removal Chain Programming Problem - C++ Solution
posted on January 25, 2017 by admin	in C++, Programming

The following presents my solution for the Longest Chain of Character Removals problem.

Problem Statement
You are given a library with n words (w[0], w[1], ...,w[n-1]). You choose a word from it, and in each step, remove one letter from this word only if doing so yields another word in the library. What is the longest possible chain of these removal steps?

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 50000
1 <= the length of each string in w <= 50
Each string is composed of lowercase ascii letters only
The function should take in an array of strings w as its argument and should return a single integer representing the length of the longest chain of character removals possible.

Example input/output
a
b
ba
bca
bda
bdca

Calling the function on the input above should output 4. The longest possible chain is "bdca" -> "bca" -> "ba" -> "a".
